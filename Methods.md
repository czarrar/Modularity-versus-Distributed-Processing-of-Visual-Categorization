## Correlations

**Simple Classifiers**. We first wanted to see how well we could classify each visual category based on data from one set of the data. We applied this approach to the pearson correlations and then to the sparse inverse correlations using the adaptive lasso for the regularization (i.e., semi-partial correlation).

**Amount of unique information**. For the semi-partial correlation, we can quantify how many of the elements are significantly non-zero across our 20 subjects and in particular focusing on the diagonal. We can also plot the diagonal information into one 4D file (and or plot it and save it to a file). Our goal would be to see if for any region there is a significant amount of unique information for a given category.

**Relation of semi-partial correlations across regions**. Here, we want to show that the pattern of relationships between the categories is not unique across the cortex. Instead there appear to be X clusters.

- Calculate the correlation
- Calculate the partial correlation
- Plot the diagonal of the partial correlation
- Cluster the partial correlations? Or maybe just do some type of correlation between matrices.
