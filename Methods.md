## Correlations

**Simple Classifiers**. We first wanted to see how well we could classify each visual category based on data from one set of the data. We applied this approach to the pearson correlations and then to the sparse inverse correlations using the adaptive lasso for the regularization.

**Amount of unique information**. For the 

- Calculate the correlation
- Calculate the partial correlation
- Plot the diagonal of the partial correlation
- Cluster the partial correlations? Or maybe just do some type of correlation between matrices.
- I want to do some significance testing...I can use the AFNI permuted data or I could just use the data across the 20 subjects for a simpler t-test.
