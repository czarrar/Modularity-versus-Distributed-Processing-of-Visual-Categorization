# Introduction

Two dominant theories of cognitive function have been modularity and distributed processing. Modularity suggests that the brain is composed of distinct units or modules, and each module is specialized for a particular function (e.g., audition or vision) **(cite)**. In contrast, distributed processing proposes that each brain area engages in many different processes, and the response across a set of brain regions (and not just one) reflects a particular function **(cite)**.

Combinations of these two theories have also been suggested. For instance, work in the 1800s has suggested that lower-level functions such as motor and vision might be modular, while higher order functions like memory and attention are spread across many brain areas (cite). These debates have continued into modern times.
