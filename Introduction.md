# Introduction

Two dominant theories of cognitive function have been modularity and distributed processing. Modularity suggests that the brain is composed of distinct units or modules, and each module is specialized for a particular function (e.g., audition or vision) **(cite)**. In contrast, distributed processing proposes that each brain area engages in many different processes, and the response across a set of brain regions (and not just one) reflects a particular function **(cite)**. Although evidence since the 1800s have been proposed for the modularity and distributed theories, definitive support for one model has been more elusive. In this paper, we focus on the debate over localized or distributed processing of visual categeries, namely faces, ...

- I could discuss work from flourens etc finding that removing certain parts of the brain led to blah. Can discuss human work with TMS and also lesions in humans (e.g., broca?). [not sure where stimulation with TMS of humans would go here]

- More recently, fMRI evidence has also supported both accounts. A large body of literature has localized vary functions to particular brain regions.... In particular, in the ventral visual stream, we find... However, use of mvpa analyses have shown that information may in fact be distributed. Although certain brain areas might be more selective for some categories, there is information for non-selective categories.

I could divide this into a paragraph on modularity and distributed processing. 

So so far when we've discussed, we have said that well it could be. We think that 


Combinations of these two theories have also been suggested. For instance, work in the 1800s has suggested that lower-level functions such as motor and vision might be modular, while higher order functions like memory and attention are spread across many brain areas (cite). These debates have continued into modern times.
