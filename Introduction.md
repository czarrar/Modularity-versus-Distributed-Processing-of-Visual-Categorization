# Introduction

I see two options here.

1. I can talk about how modularity and distributed processing are two of the dominant theories of neural organization or brain function.
2. I can talk about flourens and what he found. By removing parts of the brain, he was able to localize function although he did not find evidence for certain higher-order functions. Other work suggested that much of the brain was needed... Ok yeah I'm going with the first.

Since the 1800s, debates have raged on the neural organization of cognitive functioning. 
Two dominant theories of cognitive function have been modularity and distributed processing. Since the 1800s, evidence has been suggested for both the modular and distributed perspective. Lesion evidence of animals has found ... () and more recently stimulation studies in humans (cite) support a localization perspective. 

Debates between modularity and distributed processing 

The first is the theory of modularity. Stemming from phrenology, this theory supports functional specialization, suggesting the brain has different modules that are domain specific in function. The second theory, distributive processing, proposes that the brain is more interactive and its regions are functionally interconnected rather than specialized.
